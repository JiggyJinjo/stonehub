# Stonehub

**Stonehub** is an extension for the progressive idle game  **[Idlescape.com](https://idlescape.com/game)**.
Runs through Tampermonkey.

The extension runs as a standalone but works even better with [Stonehub_updateUI_xyz](https://github.com/atomicwelding/stonehub_updateUI_xyz)!

### + Features


The extension intends to add some pretty nice QoL features :
> ####  - Autorefresh Marketplace
###### You'll never need to click the refresh button again! It's all automated now. It does refresh too when one of your items is sold.

> ####  - Resell Auctions
###### Change the price of your auctions and the stack size you want to sell without cancelling your auctions first!

### + How to install the script

Stonehub needs you to install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) at the first place.
You can then go [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/415684-stonehub) and click on the install button!
